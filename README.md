# Justin's Retro Personal Site

This repository is a learning sandbox where I rebuild the spirit of late-90s personal homepages with modern tooling. The goal is to practice accessible, responsive front-end techniques while indulging in a Windows 98 aesthetic.

## What I'm Experimenting With
- **Retro-inspired UI**: Re-creating desktop metaphors (windows, taskbar, Start menu) using plain HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript.
- **Accessibility refinements**: Keeping keyboard and screen-reader users in mind, e.g. ARIA attributes, focus management, and semantic markup.
- **Content structure**: Laying the groundwork for a blog and future project pages that can be expanded as I learn more.

## Current Features
- Home page that introduces the site and links into the retro "JustinOS" interface.
- Blog listing plus a few sample posts to test windowed layouts and navigation.
- Shared styles and scripts that keep the Start menu behavior consistent and approachable for keyboard users.

## Roadmap / Learning Goals
1. Build out real project and about pages while keeping the OS metaphor understandable.
2. Experiment with a lightweight build step (templating, bundling) to reduce repetition across pages.
3. Prototype interactive desktop elements like draggable icons or multiple window panes.
4. Continue improving accessibility, especially focus order and screen reader announcements for dynamic UI.

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in a browser to explore the site. No build process is required; all assets are static.

Feedback, tips, and vintage web inspiration are always welcome!
